                >Pegasus is a winged divine stallion, usually depicted as pure
                white in color, in Greek mythology. He was sired by Poseidon, in
                his role as horse-god, and foaled by the Gorgon Medusa. Pegasus
                was the brother of Chrysaor, both born at a single birthing when
                their mother was decapitated by Perseus. Greco-Roman poets wrote
                about his ascent to heaven after his birth and his obeisance to
                Zeus, king of the gods, who instructed him to bring lightning
                and thunder from Olympus.

                The Nemean lion was a monster in Greek mythology that lived at
                Nemea. Eventually, it was killed by Heracles (Hercules). Because
                its golden fur was impervious to attack, it could not be killed
                with mortals' weapons. Its claws were sharper than mortals'
                swords and could destroy any strong armour. In Bibliotheca,
                Photius wrote that the dragon Ladon, who guarded the golden
                apples, was his brother.

                >In Greek mythology, Cerberus, often referred to as the hound of
                Hades, is a multi-headed dog that guards the gates of the
                Underworld to prevent the dead from leaving. He was the
                offspring of the monsters Echidna and Typhon, and was usually
                described as having three heads, a serpent for a tail, and
                snakes protruding from multiple parts of his body. Cerberus is
                primarily known for his capture by Heracles, the last of
                Heracles' twelve labours.</cite
