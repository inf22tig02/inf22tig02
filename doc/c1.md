# C1 : Animals in Mythology

## Description
Our group was assigned to design a minimum of 4 static pages about animals. The main theme chosen for the assignment was Animals in different mythologies, using 3 static pages to display 3 different mythologies and a home page to navigate. The chosen mythologies were Egyptian, which has a great focus on animals as central deities, and Greek and Norse mythology which has a great variety of different animals as fantastic creatures.
